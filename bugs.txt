FIX BEFORE BETA 2
=================

- Civilians stop dead when keeper intervention gets in their way! Either give them internal keys to the gates, or modify their patrol routes for the duration of the intervention to turn back.

- On Normal, the doorway between Sanctuary library and the other room has a black rectangle

- On Normal, the doorway to the south caves has a black rectangle

- Guard patrolling outside sanctuary gets stuck on lamppost if heading from one door to the other.

- Market square conv should trigger from Eagle-Eyed Jack's perch.

- Save and load just after the manor bowman conversation, and the guy who should continue patrolling to the back yard just stops where he is :(

- Secret treasure door in mausoleum is silent

- Dump the canister troll chest in the manor. (but what to replace it with?)

- Need to update ritual script so OnLastBlessing destroys the hand at the right moment.

- Audio propagation issues: probably related to room brushes that are too long in one dimension:
    - Odd audio in Fountain Square: couldn't hear both guards properly at the same time: is the room split badly?
    - Hammer conversation is damn near inaudible! And you can't get close to eavesdrop better.
    - di Rupo guard conversation is inaudible if you drop over the western end of the wall. :(
    - Weird sound in the cemetery: can't hear locked gates when frobbing them from cemetry side until right up to them.
    - (sound propagation?) Ritual chant is inaudible from antechamber mouth.
    - Sound propagation into water room from hallway seems unmuted by the doors.

- Other audio propagation issues:
    - Bad sound propagation at manor: standing in the garden below the open window, can hear footsteps of guard on marble in long gallery.
    - More bad sound propagation at manor: standing in the secret room, can hear footsteps of guard on marble in long gallery.

- collector tower above Argaux's place is not in a room brush

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- various voids: fountain square blustone building, rich street

- Prophet has trouble pathfinding in the catacombs -- seek out the problem areas and fix!

- Give one of the thieves a purse.

- (Why are there two guards patrolling outside the sanctuary? Is one the guard from Hammer square?? This makes three altogether, where's the difficulty variation?)

- A few hammerites should have purses or healing potions

- Warden's chest is locked but empty!?

- Tower steps should have different texture, they're almost invisible.

- Sanctuary basement isn't lit _at all_!!

- Opera archer takes _way_ too long to turn.

- Bugbeast seemed to come right for me (just east of steps) when searching... how? Is there a trol point down there? Review the search trol points.

- Needs to be something to land on beside wall across from works station, so you don't hurt yourself leaving that way.

- EscapeWithTheAnax doesn't trigger in the alley.

- Rich streets keeper appears _in front_ of Garrett, just

- Hammerite sanctuary stairs are almost invisible... have something at the end of each hallway for visible contrast.



FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================



ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- You can get onto the cemetery wall by mantling the crayman obelisk. Probably don't care.

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Cemetery keeper appears right beside the statue of Death. Nice :)

- Use R insignia door for safe.
