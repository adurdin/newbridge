FIX BEFORE BETA 1
=================


FIX BEFORE BETA 2
=================

- Misc
    - "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"
    - "I don't think the blue bricks work well as the roof texture [east main street by hangman square]"
    - "You might want to AlignExt textures in places like this" - textures in drunk archer's tower
    - Sky glitches visible above east fountain square buildings, from under sky bridge, from alley, from fountain square itself.
    - Sky glitches visible from upper street looking towards hammer square.

- When the intervention starts, destroy delivery di rupo and things.
    - Or better, when we close the door behind Garrett after the handoff

- Crypt doors disappeared for marbleman.

- Audio propagation issues: probably related to room brushes that are too long in one dimension:
    - Odd audio in Fountain Square: couldn't hear both guards properly at the same time: is the room split badly?
    - Hammer conversation is damn near inaudible! And you can't get close to eavesdrop better.
    - di Rupo guard conversation is inaudible if you drop over the western end of the wall. :(
    - Weird sound in the cemetery: can't hear locked gates when frobbing them from cemetry side until right up to them.
    - (sound propagation?) Ritual chant is inaudible from antechamber mouth.
    - Sound propagation into water room from hallway seems unmuted by the doors.
    - At -6.82,207,-276, can't hear the guard a few feet away! Bad propagation again, sigh. Possibly the weird overlap of square and diagonal rooms?
    - In cave at 61.7, 247, -292 can hear guard outside walking on the gravel.

- Other audio propagation issues:
    - Bad sound propagation at manor: standing in the garden below the open window, can hear footsteps of guard on marble in long gallery.
    - More bad sound propagation at manor: standing in the secret room, can hear footsteps of guard on marble in long gallery.


FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================



ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- You can get onto the cemetery wall by mantling the crayman obelisk. Probably don't care.

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- hammerite sanctuary gate clips into ground.

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?
    - Looks like I might have to edit the motion database to add a new tag for only the low attacks, just for him? Yikes.
    - Probably not worth it. He's meant to be scary, rather than actually deadly after all.

- BUG: you can kill the Canal keeper and (except on Expert) it doesn't matter :D

- Delivery di Rupo and Keepers freeze while Garrett is talking... are there tags for the standing idle motion I could use?
