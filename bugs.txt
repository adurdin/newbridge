FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================

- Hmm, maybe move Hammerite map into more hidden location in secret room? Dillon found it in Argaux's other room and assumed it (and the rune boards) were probably the thing he was after (even though they didn't relate to anything he already knew ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

- prjames reports prisoner did not run away after being freed. Investigate.


ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- hammerite sanctuary gate clips into ground.
    - bigger problem is AIs don't know it's a door for pathing because it doesn't separate two rooms!

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?
    - Looks like I might have to edit the motion database to add a new tag for only the low attacks, just for him? Yikes.
    - Probably not worth it. He's meant to be scary, rather than actually deadly after all.

- BUG: you can kill the Canal keeper and (except on Expert) it doesn't matter :D

- Delivery di Rupo and Keepers freeze while Garrett is talking... are there tags for the standing idle motion I could use?

- "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"

- Crypt doors disappeared for marbleman.

- Olver can get stuck along his patrol route, and stop moving... but the pathfinding looks fine, so I don't know why. Gonna let it be.
