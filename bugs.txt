FIX BEFORE BETA 2
=================

- Middle St West works station between serpent towers needs machinery ambience in its door.

- Sleeping standing up guard needs to make spluttering sound the moment you enter his hitbox to warn you.

- Can still hear fainting guy from the metal bit on argaux's rooftop path??

- Put a smidgen of extra light on Danno's mine.

- Middle street west guard is impossible to sneak by! D:

- Some of the Hammer Square north water arrows should be gone on Hard/Expert

- Getting to faining guy's place is still too hard: noisy metal (and stone actually), and significant risk of hurt.

- When the intervention starts, destroy delivery di rupo and things.
    - Or better, when we close the door behind Garrett after the handoff

- Crypt doors disappeared for marbleman.

- South street merchant wanderer didn't run until I raised my weapon.

- One of the rich street wanderers should have a different route, and not go all the way into Market square

- Getting the priceless Hammerite Relic fucks up the loot objective! Either it has to go into the loot pile, or it shouldn't be loot. Can't have it both ways.

- Frogs are slightly too quiet

- Hammer south garden door opens inwards! As does the North one.

- Fountain alley sleeper doesn't snore

- Turbines on Argaux's roof are just a little too loud! One by Hammer walkways is okay now though

- Hammers still get stuck on that dang lamppost
    - Make all lamposts "repel" and AI don't collide!

- Cowardly hammer sometimes doesn't stop running D:
    - seems he misses the watchpoint or sth when saving and loading happens?
    - just keep a watch on his patrol points to remove the metaproperty, so he gets a chance for it to happen over and over?


- Small old lampposts in front of Sanctuary don't have ambience!

- Lamppost ambience should be a touch quieter.

- Sanctuary front guard (Hard/Expert) stands in one doorway for _waaaaay_ too long.

- Danno's room: if mine is destroyed, its sound still plays!

- Audio propagation issues: probably related to room brushes that are too long in one dimension:
    - Odd audio in Fountain Square: couldn't hear both guards properly at the same time: is the room split badly?
    - di Rupo guard conversation is inaudible if you drop over the western end of the wall. :(
    - (sound propagation?) Ritual chant is inaudible from antechamber mouth.

- Sound issues:

FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================



ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- You can get onto the cemetery wall by mantling the crayman obelisk. Probably don't care.

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- hammerite sanctuary gate clips into ground.

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?
    - Looks like I might have to edit the motion database to add a new tag for only the low attacks, just for him? Yikes.
    - Probably not worth it. He's meant to be scary, rather than actually deadly after all.

- BUG: you can kill the Canal keeper and (except on Expert) it doesn't matter :D

- Delivery di Rupo and Keepers freeze while Garrett is talking... are there tags for the standing idle motion I could use?

- "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"
