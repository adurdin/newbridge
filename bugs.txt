FIX BEFORE BETA 1
=================


FIX BEFORE BETA 2
=================

- AAAAAAAAAAAAH - somehow for malasdair, the VoiceOfGarrett for the delivery convo fell into the floor! How and why??
    - And then the conversation doesn't play, and then things just don't work!
    - perhaps I can simply script the other AI in the conversation to 'play' Garrett's lines for him instead? Would sidestep the need to understand the problem.
    - alternatively, tp the garrett voice to the conversation when starting it, I suppose, for another workaround.

- Remove sanctuary front secret door - it's now wooden :D

- Priest's patrol path takes him out the hallway door of vestibule, I don't want that.

- Picked up a quiver when had no broadheads, and All my broadhead arrows now looked like [i]quivers[/i] - while aiming (blocking out half of my vision), while shooting, and also if they stuck in wood after shooting.

- "if I drop the Anax in [the delivery room], I can't pick him up and it unchecks the Anax objective." -- it shouldn't untick the objective at this point, since you've done the job.

- Should the Warden's nameplate have a quotation or not?

- Catacombs is confusing to people. Maybe a couple more landmarks?
    - Or not. So far nobody's reporting real difficulty.
    - Move loot around so it's less hidden, add one or two more pieces.
    - Maybe landmark the entrance/exit just a touch more.

- Misc
    - "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"
    - "Wrong texture? [bottom of window on middle street works station!]
    - "I don't think the blue bricks work well as the roof texture [east main street by hangman square]"
    - "You might want to AlignExt textures in places like this" - textures in drunk archer's tower
    - Sky glitches visible above east fountain square buildings, from under sky bridge, from alley, from fountain square itself.

- Double doors when unlocking: only one unlocks, but both open.
    - Maybe use a single fnordlock for both of them?

- Guards attacking are a problem for the Keeper intervention and the ending.
    - Close the gates when stuff happens, but hold off tping the keeper in until there's no more attack (or high awareness? or investigate?) links to the player. Check on enter the room... maybe also spawn a timer when in the room?
    - ending keeper might need slightly different handling, since he doesn't tp in behind you after all.

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?
    - Looks like I might have to edit the motion database to add a new tag for only the low attacks, just for him? Yikes.
    - Probably not worth it. He's meant to be scary, rather than actually deadly after all.

- Civilians stop dead when keeper intervention gets in their way! Either give them internal keys to the gates, or modify their patrol routes for the duration of the intervention to turn back.

- Market square conv should maybe trigger from Eagle-Eyed Jack's perch.

- When the intervention starts, destroy delivery di rupo and things.

- Dump the canister troll chest in the manor. (but what to replace it with?)

- Need to update ritual script so OnLastBlessing destroys the hand at the right moment.

- Crypt doors disappeared for marbleman.

- Audio propagation issues: probably related to room brushes that are too long in one dimension:
    - Odd audio in Fountain Square: couldn't hear both guards properly at the same time: is the room split badly?
    - Hammer conversation is damn near inaudible! And you can't get close to eavesdrop better.
    - di Rupo guard conversation is inaudible if you drop over the western end of the wall. :(
    - Weird sound in the cemetery: can't hear locked gates when frobbing them from cemetry side until right up to them.
    - (sound propagation?) Ritual chant is inaudible from antechamber mouth.
    - Sound propagation into water room from hallway seems unmuted by the doors.
    - At -6.82,207,-276, can't hear the guard a few feet away! Bad propagation again, sigh. Possibly the weird overlap of square and diagonal rooms?
    - In cave at 61.7, 247, -292 can hear guard outside walking on the gravel.

- Other audio propagation issues:
    - Bad sound propagation at manor: standing in the garden below the open window, can hear footsteps of guard on marble in long gallery.
    - More bad sound propagation at manor: standing in the secret room, can hear footsteps of guard on marble in long gallery.

- various voids: fountain square blustone building, rich street

- Prophet has trouble pathfinding in the catacombs -- seek out the problem areas and fix!

- A few hammerites should have purses or healing potions

- EscapeWithTheAnax doesn't trigger in the alley.
    - Fix this when doing room brushes.

- Chest in manor library secret room is empty?

- Sanctuary map doesn't show upper walkways
- Sanctuary map doesn't show bell tower

FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================



ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- You can get onto the cemetery wall by mantling the crayman obelisk. Probably don't care.

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.
