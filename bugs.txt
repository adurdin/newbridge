ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT

- Disappearing terrain:
    - Between the fountain and the hangman's noose on the map there is a drunk archer in a tower. If you face NW, you can sometimes see a bit of terrain disappear.
    - Standing on the east side of market square and heading west, can sometimes see the Sanctuary roof appear and disappear.

- Should there be some kind of hint about the sharp-eyed archer?

- nightshifter encountered a Hammerite guard outside the sanctuary who was stopped dead, not moving and not apparently reacting to anything (is this the cowardly one - yes it is? is this their aiwatch pseudoscript fucking up? or an absolute-priority response, or what?)
    - He's stuck in: [AI(870) Watch: Flow] changed goal to "'Custom Goal' at priority 'Absolute'", ability "Converse"
        - Think this is due to the double-trigger I had in beta 2 but since removed. Come to think of it, the guard getting stuck in a running animation was probably the same thing too.

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- hammerite sanctuary gate clips into ground.
    - bigger problem is AIs don't know it's a door for pathing because it doesn't separate two rooms!

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?
    - Looks like I might have to edit the motion database to add a new tag for only the low attacks, just for him? Yikes.
    - Probably not worth it. He's meant to be scary, rather than actually deadly after all.

- BUG: you can kill the Canal keeper and (except on Expert) it doesn't matter :D

- Delivery di Rupo and Keepers freeze while Garrett is talking... are there tags for the standing idle motion I could use?

- "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"

- Crypt doors disappeared for marbleman.

- Olver can get stuck along his patrol route, and stop moving... but the pathfinding looks fine, so I don't know why. Gonna let it be.
