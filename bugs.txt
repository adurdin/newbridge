FIX BEFORE BETA 1
=================


FIX BEFORE BETA 2
=================

- Catacombs is confusing to people. Maybe a couple more landmarks?

- People aren't making the connection between the plaque and the items around the room :(
    - Any way to make that more obvious, I wonder?

- Conversation problems (reported by marbleman):
    - "If I save and reload after these two [guard+hammerite] finish their convo and start patrolling normally, they restart the convo"
    - "These guys [benny+sergeant by clock] just stop, but they do keep on patrolling a bit later"
    - "Same with these guys [priest+hammerite]"
    - "This thief [Danno] stops"
    - GENERALLY it seems Returns to Origin should not be relied on. Instead I should probably DoesPatrol with a specific link to next patrol point.

- marbleman reported (Expert) "the last line the keeper says seems to be a placeholder. Was it not recoded with the others?"

- Out of bounds
    - "Got out of bounds here [by canal]" - needs a little care to prevent accessing anything outwith canal zone after reaching there.
    - "And here" - above turbines by Argaux's, by mantling a shutter.

- Room brushing
    - "This apartment [Danno's] shares a room with the corridor outside, which is kind of a big deal since you have to jump over the mine and can alert the guard that way"

- Misc
    - "It's a bit difficult to drop here [fountain square balcony] without losing health"
    - "Carts have wrong material metaprop: they sound like metal"
    - "[in Warden's temp quarters] The footlocker is locked but empty. Dunno if that's intended. The barrels in the corner are not solid"
    - "This barrel [upstairs in warehouse] is also not solid."
    - "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"
    - "Wrong texture? [bottom of window on middle street works station!]
    - "I don't think the blue bricks work well as the roof texture [east main street by hangman square]"
    - "You might want to AlignExt textures in places like this" - textures in drunk archer's tower

- Double doors when unlocking: only one unlocks, but both open.

- Guards attacking are a problem for the Keeper intervention and the ending.

- Payment+loot setup caused confusion.

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?

- Broken hidden lever for the middle streets work station's secret door? So at least there's a lever to find? Or maybe just tweak its lighting so it's less visible.

- Civilians stop dead when keeper intervention gets in their way! Either give them internal keys to the gates, or modify their patrol routes for the duration of the intervention to turn back.

- Guard patrolling outside sanctuary gets stuck on lamppost if heading from one door to the other.

- Market square conv should trigger from Eagle-Eyed Jack's perch.

- Save and load just after the manor bowman conversation, and the guy who should continue patrolling to the back yard just stops where he is :(

- When the intervention starts, destroy delivery di rupo and things.

- Secret treasure door in mausoleum is silent

- Wandering merchant (middle streets) is not knocked out easily

- Dump the canister troll chest in the manor. (but what to replace it with?)

- Need to update ritual script so OnLastBlessing destroys the hand at the right moment.

- Audio propagation issues: probably related to room brushes that are too long in one dimension:
    - Odd audio in Fountain Square: couldn't hear both guards properly at the same time: is the room split badly?
    - Hammer conversation is damn near inaudible! And you can't get close to eavesdrop better.
    - di Rupo guard conversation is inaudible if you drop over the western end of the wall. :(
    - Weird sound in the cemetery: can't hear locked gates when frobbing them from cemetry side until right up to them.
    - (sound propagation?) Ritual chant is inaudible from antechamber mouth.
    - Sound propagation into water room from hallway seems unmuted by the doors.
    - At -6.82,207,-276, can't hear the guard a few feet away! Bad propagation again, sigh. Possibly the weird overlap of square and diagonal rooms?

- Other audio propagation issues:
    - Bad sound propagation at manor: standing in the garden below the open window, can hear footsteps of guard on marble in long gallery.
    - More bad sound propagation at manor: standing in the secret room, can hear footsteps of guard on marble in long gallery.

- collector tower above Argaux's place is not in a room brush

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- various voids: fountain square blustone building, rich street

- Prophet has trouble pathfinding in the catacombs -- seek out the problem areas and fix!

- Give one of the thieves a purse.

- (Why are there two guards patrolling outside the sanctuary? Is one the guard from Hammer square?? This makes three altogether, where's the difficulty variation?)

- A few hammerites should have purses or healing potions

- Warden's chest is locked but empty!?

- Tower steps should have different texture, they're almost invisible.

- Sanctuary basement isn't lit _at all_!!

- Opera archer takes _way_ too long to turn.

- Bugbeast seemed to come right for me (just east of steps) when searching... how? Is there a trol point down there? Review the search trol points.

- Needs to be something to land on beside wall across from works station, so you don't hurt yourself leaving that way.

- EscapeWithTheAnax doesn't trigger in the alley.

- Hammerite sanctuary stairs are almost invisible... have something at the end of each hallway for visible contrast.



FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================



ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- You can get onto the cemetery wall by mantling the crayman obelisk. Probably don't care.

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.
