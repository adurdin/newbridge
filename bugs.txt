BUGS:

- After delivery conversation, can enter the fishmongers and then go back in--which closes the door on you! Bad, cause I need to destroy the DeliveryDiRupo, Hand, and Anax at that point. To fix, make the door-close trigger when _entering_ the market square (or the alleyway just off it), and not on _exiting_ the "in front of fishmongers".

- Garrett discovers the Anax is a person upon entering the crypt -- but might not yet have actually seen the Anax in person! See if we can do it when the Anax enters his view. But first, cause it's simpler, just make it when he enters the _Eastern_ crypt room where the Anax hangs out.

- Does the Keeper intervention actually work in practice? Bearing in mind the player could be pursued by guards at the time! Can I just have the gates already shut + locked to prevent that, and only trigger the keeper appearing if not in combat? Also the keeper doesn't wait for Garrett to turn around and face him before continuing to talk, and I don't know if that's an issue.

- Misaligned textures and overlapping rooms in the manor

- Can get _slightly_ too high in the bell tower and see the carpet of the world. Tweak it slightly. Also, climbing to the top of your rope gets you stuck between the beams and the bell; check the bell's dimensions.

- Ritual person-shaped particle system should start one vertex previous?

- Wind sound effect blowing out torch suggests air, which I don't want. Also should be slight wind sfx near air lever, if possible.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- The apparition of The Prophet in the mausoleum ought to get destroyed when the ritual begins.

- The door in front of the fishmongers doesn't trigger reliably (possibly blocked by the player?) Make sure--after the rebuild--it opens *inward* to the room and detects if the player dropped the hand and/or the anax in the room area and then picks them up again.

- Need actual stairs in Hammer Sanctuary, not just ramps

- Lever behind statue in Hammer Sanctuary needs to be visible without climbing up beside. Doesn't need to be _that_ hidden.

- Reading the notice after reading di rupo's journal shows the already-cancelled FindArgauxInfaux objective

- Door outside fishmonger's isn't opening reliably...
