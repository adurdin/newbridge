FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================

- Fountain has no flow brush.

- prjames: In the lady's manor, you can frob plates (in kitchen and pantry) and they go into your inventory.
    - should be junk items

- prjames: Getting into the mausoleum:… I first lobbed rubble at the partially damaged door to the small tomb that has the broken entrance…
    - ooh, tempted to make this viable

- prjames: Later, I did try dropping the [tomb robber's] note and shooting it with a water arrow to see if the blood would come out - no luck.
    - ooh, tempted to make this viable
        - It's only a few decals.... hmm.

- prjames reports prisoner did not run away after being freed. Investigate.

- two people now have failed to spot the lever in the bathroom. Maybe tweak it?

- Does maus puzzle research comment trigger after 4 or 5 attempts? Should be 4 but prjames said 5 (though likely not counting carefully)
    - Just checked it is 4.

- Mantling the barrels to get over the manor wall? Hmmm... It's fine I suppose. That's not why they're there... maybe they should be small barrels (even then might be able to new_mantle it, which is okay I guess)?


ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- hammerite sanctuary gate clips into ground.
    - bigger problem is AIs don't know it's a door for pathing because it doesn't separate two rooms!

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?
    - Looks like I might have to edit the motion database to add a new tag for only the low attacks, just for him? Yikes.
    - Probably not worth it. He's meant to be scary, rather than actually deadly after all.

- BUG: you can kill the Canal keeper and (except on Expert) it doesn't matter :D

- Delivery di Rupo and Keepers freeze while Garrett is talking... are there tags for the standing idle motion I could use?

- "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"

- Crypt doors disappeared for marbleman.

- Olver can get stuck along his patrol route, and stop moving... but the pathfinding looks fine, so I don't know why. Gonna let it be.
