FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================

Uuuuughh.... reloading the save made the "Heathens" conversation play again D: - or rather, the half of it that the guard patrolling Hangman's Square said that I could hear --- did it not actually finish??
    - Make sure I kill conversation trigger links appropriately too, if they seem to be the issue.
    - weird. It doesn't trigger a third time if I then save and load again. I wonder what's up?

Footlocker in hammer square north triggers secret when frobbed, even if still locked! Should happen on open instead.

- You can get onto the cemetery wall by mantling the crayman obelisk, and bypass the keeper that way. Either make it not mantleable, or relocate it.

- Sanctuary front gate guard still stays waaaay too long, cause it makes it really hard to get in over the wall. Make it 30s.

ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- hammerite sanctuary gate clips into ground.

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?
    - Looks like I might have to edit the motion database to add a new tag for only the low attacks, just for him? Yikes.
    - Probably not worth it. He's meant to be scary, rather than actually deadly after all.

- BUG: you can kill the Canal keeper and (except on Expert) it doesn't matter :D

- Delivery di Rupo and Keepers freeze while Garrett is talking... are there tags for the standing idle motion I could use?

- "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"

- Crypt doors disappeared for marbleman.
