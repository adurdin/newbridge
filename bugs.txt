FIX BEFORE RELEASE
==================

---- SOUND ----

- Does it start with a keehit_s?

- Garrett's in-game lines are a bit too loud.

- Mine arming is a little too quiet.

- Argaux's rope is probably a little too loud.

- When reading Argaux's letter from Lady di Rupo (in the secret room) I think there needs to be a delay before the VO plays, otherwise the 'new objective' sound obscures the beginning of it.

- Guard conversation is inaudible after hopping over wall by work station. (nightshifter)
- Nightshifter also reports that the market square convo starts too soon, but not that it is inaudible.

---- OBJECTIVES ----

- It appears that picking up the Anax immediately fulfils the objective, but that feels too early. It's not like a regular quest object. Getting hold of the Anax is just the start. Perhaps the goal should remain incomplete until the player leaves the sanctuary. Same goes for the VO 'One down, one to go'.

- You could trigger the Anax objective at the top of the stairs up from the crypt.  That should suit most people.

---- BAD DOORS ----

- disappearing door in the barracks (near the cells).

---- MISC ---

- The fainting nobleman (Sven) has a Thief carry body icon.

- Lady di Rupo's butler (Baltasar) has the wrong carry body icon (not sure if a matching one exists).

- In the Hammerites' library, their book on pagans tries to stand upright when dropped, which contradicts the physics model.


ONLY IF I FEEL LIKE IT
======================

- Disappearing terrain:
    - Between the fountain and the hangman's noose on the map there is a drunk archer in a tower. If you face NW, you can sometimes see a bit of terrain disappear.
    - Standing on the east side of market square and heading west, can sometimes see the Sanctuary roof appear and disappear.

- Should there be some kind of hint about the sharp-eyed archer?

- Con guard (sleeping standing up) giving off bad creature pos errors

- Use R insignia door for safe.

- Need to make buildings near Argaux's rooftop entrance taller by ~8, to block vis into fountain square.

- hammerite sanctuary gate clips into ground.
    - bigger problem is AIs don't know it's a door for pathing because it doesn't separate two rooms!

- Prophet apparitions usually misses you when you're crouched?
    - Looks like I might have to edit the motion database to add a new tag for only the low attacks, just for him? Yikes.
    - Probably not worth it. He's meant to be scary, rather than actually deadly after all.

- BUG: you can kill the Canal keeper and (except on Expert) it doesn't matter :D

- Delivery di Rupo and Keepers freeze while Garrett is talking... are there tags for the standing idle motion I could use?

- "You can kinda see the sky glitching out from here [beside tower, looking through fence]"

- Olver can get stuck along his patrol route, and stop moving... but the pathfinding looks fine, so I don't know why. Gonna let it be.
