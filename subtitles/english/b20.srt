00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Seven time roundsy and seven time downsy

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dances and sings we and bless with them hand

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Tears pridesy builderfools flesh for our banquets

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And wakers dead prophet from ravenous sleeps

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A professional acquaintance of mine, Argaux, got in touch with an offer of a job in Newbridge.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He won't give me any details--maybe he's afraid I'll do it on the sly and he'll lose out on his fee?--but he says it's urgent.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And it pays generously.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've never been to Newbridge before, but I hear it's a dark, quiet little backwater on the outskirts of the city.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The area's under the thumb of Lady di Rupo, a wealthy grandee with a fancy mansion up on the cliffside.

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll need to keep an eye open for her guards while I'm in the neighbourhood: they're not exactly welcoming to thieves.

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Reportedly the Hammers have recently started trying to wrestle control of the district for themselves, and this has been causing trouble.

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
People tell me di Rupo has no love for the Order of the Hammer--but then neither do I.

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Although I do like all the gold they use to decorate their temples.

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Whatever else this job entails, visiting Newbridge will be an interesting change of scene.

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'll go along and meet Argaux by the fountain, and hear what he has to say.
