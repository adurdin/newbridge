00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:08,833
Seven time roundsie and seven time downsie

00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:14,833
Dances and sings we and bless with them hand

3
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:20,833
Tears pridesy builderfools flesh for our banquets

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:26,166
And wakers dead prophet from ravenous sleeps

6
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:44,100
A professional acquaintance of mine, Argaux, got in touch with an offer of a job in Newbridge.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,166
He won't give me the details yet - maybe he's afraid I'll do it on the sly and he'll lose out on his fee?

8
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,733
But he says it's urgent. And it pays generously.

9
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:03,000
I've never been to Newbridge before, but I hear it's a dark, quiet little backwater on the outskirts of the city.

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,166
The whole area's under the thumb of Lady di Rupo, a wealthy grandee with a fancy mansion up on the cliffside.

11
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:16,300
I'll need to keep an eye out for her guards while I'm in the neighbourhood: they're not exactly welcoming to thieves.

12
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:29,033
Reportedly the Hammers have recently started trying to wrestle control of the district for themselves, and this has been causing trouble.

13
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:34,833
People tell me di Rupo has no love for the Order of the Hammer - but then neither do I.

14
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:39,333
Although I do like all the gold they use to decorate their temples.

15
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,300
Whatever else this job entails, visiting Newbridge will be an interesting change of scene.

16
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:51,833
I'll go along and meet Argaux by the fountain, and hear what he has to say.
