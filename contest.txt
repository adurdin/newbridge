This mission is an entry to TTLG's 'Thief: The Dark Project 20th Anniversary
Contest' (http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=148475). As per the
rules, the mission is almost entirely stock resources. Here is a list and
details of all the custom sound and image resources used:

    books/decals
        Custom book decal art, being a bloodstain that obscures crucial text
        on a note.

    books/paganbk
        Custom book art, representing an ancient pagan tome written in an
        unknown language.

    books/parch
        Unmodified copy of stock 'parch' art, so that the briefing book can
        be shown if the movie is missing or disabled.

    books/stoned4a
        Copy of stock 'stoned4' art, but with the font size reduced from 45
        pixels high to 30 pixels high, so that a little more text can fit.
        Stone plaques, after all, don't normally have pages.

        Unmodified copy of stock obj/txt/grav2.gif for use on world brushes.

    fam/nubrij/mawsto20.pcx

        have different material properties assigned.

        intrface/main.pcx, and the mission name overlaid.
