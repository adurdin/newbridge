Version                 : Beta 1
Date of Release         : Sep 26, 2018

Description:

    A professional acquaintance of mine, Argaux, got in touch with an offer
    of a job in Newbridge. He won't give me any details--maybe he's afraid
    I'll do it on the sly and he'll lose out on his fee?--but he says it's
    urgent. And it pays generously.

    I've never been to Newbridge before, but I hear it's a dark, quiet little
    backwater on the outskirts of the city. The area's under the thumb of
    Lady di Rupo, a wealthy grandee with a fancy mansion up on the cliffside.
    I'll need to keep an eye open for her guards while I'm in the
    neighbourhood: they're not exactly welcoming to thieves.

    Reportedly the Hammers have recently started trying to wrestle control of
    the district for themselves, and this has been causing trouble. People
    tell me di Rupo has no love for the Order of the Hammer--but then neither
    do I. Although I do like all the gold they use to decorate their temples.

    Whatever else this job entails, visiting Newbridge will be an interesting
    change of scene. I'll go along and meet Argaux by the fountain, and hear
    what he has to say.

* Loading Information *

The NewDark 1.26 patch is required to run this mission. The GOG release of
Thief Gold is recommended, as it comes with the latest NewDark preinstalled:

    https://www.gog.com/game/thief_gold

If your Thief Gold comes from another source, you must apply the NewDark
1.26 patch manually (http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=146448)
or using TFix (http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134733).
This mission was designed with the original low-resolution textures and
models in mind, and the use of any enhancement packs or texture packs is not
recommended. They probably won't break anything, but might not look right.

You should use NewDark's FMSel feature to run this mission. You can run the
game with the -fm argument to launch the FM selector:

    THIEF.EXE -fm

Please see FMSel.pdf in your NewDark distribution for more information on
using FMSel. This mission has not been tested with other FM loaders such as
DarkLoader, so their use is not recommended.
