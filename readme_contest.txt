This mission is an entry to TTLG's 'Thief: The Dark Project 20th Anniversary
Contest' (http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=148475). As per the
rules, the mission is almost entirely stock resources. Here is a list and
details of all the custom sound and image resources used:

    books/decals
        Custom book art #1, being a bloodstain decal that obscures crucial
        text on a note.

    books/paganbk
        Custom book art #2, representing an ancient pagan tome written in an
        unknown language.

    books/parch
        Unmodified copy of stock 'parch' art, so that the briefing book can
        be shown if the movie is missing or disabled.

    books/stoned4a
        Copy of stock 'stoned4' art, unmodified except for reducing the font
        size from 45 pixels high to 30 pixels high, so that the crucial text
        can fit. (Stone plaques, after all, don't normally have pages.)

    fam/nubrij/grav2.pcx
        Unmodified copy of stock obj/txt/grav2.gif for use on world brushes.

    fam/nubrij/grav2a.pcx
        Unmodified copy of stock obj/txt/grav2a.gif for use on world brushes.

    fam/nubrij/grav2b.pcx
        Unmodified copy of stock obj/txt/grav2b.gif for use on world brushes.

    fam/nubrij/mawsto20.pcx
        Unmodified copy of stock fam/maw/mawsto.pcx, so that the texture can
        have different material properties assigned.

    intrface/<lang>/main_*
        Copies of stock intrface/mainold/main*, with elements from stock
        intrface/main.pcx, and the mission name overlaid.

    intrface/miss20/<lang>/page*
        Custom map artwork.

        Meshes with replacable textures, from the contest's resource pack.

    mesh/txt/dirupo.png
        Unmodified copy of stock mesh/txt16/opguestw.gif - never got around
        to modifying it!

    mesh/txt/hamanax.png
        Skin for a unique Hammerite character. Combined from stock
        mesh/txt16/hammer1h.gif and mesh/txt16/fire2.gif.

        Custom briefing movie. All music and sound effects are stock.
        Illustrations and voiceover are custom.

    movies/credits.avi
        Custom credits movie. All music and sound effects are stock.

    obj/txt/blustn.png
        Cropped copy of stock obj/txt/wdplnks6.gif, so that the stock mis11sd
        model appears to be made from wood, not stone.

    obj/txt/elem0.png
        Combined from stock obj/txt/wdplnks6.gif and obj/txt/water01.gif.

    obj/txt/elem123.png
