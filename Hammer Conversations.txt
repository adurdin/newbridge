HM1C0311: "Tis naught unto us - the ?feladine are heretics and will crumble as old wood."
HM1C0312: "Thieves respect naught. Divinity, even false divinity, is as the mud below their feet. They wist not it be clay, but shall be shaped by the Builder's hand."
HM1C0313: "Nay, our walls be cut from the thickest stones, our gates be wrought from full iron. Any who pits his strength gainst their strength shall smash himself with his own effort, even as the fruit falling from the tree dashes itself on a rock below."
HM1C0314: "The Builder places thy challenges before thee as a stairway of hewn stone up the tower of thine life. When thou seekest to add to those challenges, to compass thine pride, thou dost clutter the design of the stairway and introduce cracks and weakness through which the Trickster mayest enter and bring thy ruin!"
HM1C0315: "See that thou dost."
HM1C0321: "Rather to buttress our defenses."
HM1C0322: "Nay, tis not they who chart the building of the battle. They but put in force the will of the Baron, and the Baron chooseth not to press the attack."
HM1C0323: "Lackwit. Thinks thou the Baron wishes to defeat Blackbrook?"
HM1C0324: "How think ye? The war grants the Baron a crisis to posture before, and gains him many taxes he wouldst not otherwise see."
HM1C0325: "Infant! Tis truth. And ever so the chisel cannot know the will of the hand it serves, nor should it judge whether the mark it makes be for well or ill. Tis enough for a tool to be sharp and well crafted. Only so canst it serve the Builder."
HM1C0331: "Wilt this famine never break? The Stonemarket merchants ask yet another fifth above what they charged but a month ago! Yet I think they profit little from their sales."
HM1C0332: "I would have said myself tis due to the war between Cyric and Bonn. The lines of battle do range over and pass what were, times ago, farms and ranches."
HM1C0333: "Thine arguments are persuasive, and do show dedication. But I think thou may simplify o'ermuch."
HM1C0334: "Hmm."
HM1C0351: "Have thou learnt nothing?! That name soils thy mouth!"
HM1C0352: "Nay, simpleton. Knowest thou not to say 'Taffer' is to speak the name of the defeated adversary, the Trickster? Tis a corruption, a cloaking that acknowledges him without intent, and gives him an entry into thy thoughts."
HM1C0353: "A foe is best contested in the light, not the shadows. Allow none to so diguise themselves before thee, lest thou slip into the shadows thyself--and so be lost."

HM1C0601: "In truth I have never heard such carrying on as this thief's pawn, Cutty."
HM3C0602: "One would think these scum had never faced tribulation in their lives."
HM1C0603: "For a time I thought block four might never sleep again for his coughs! But he quiets now."
HM3C0604: "Good. Death or dorrance will be the same for him in the end."

hm1c0701: "*cough* A curse upon this dust."
hm2c0702: "Tis been this way since the renovation."
hm1c0703: "Aye, they thought stone dust would settle faster than wood. But many feet cast it up."
hm2c0704: "Come the rains, 'twill pass."
hm1c0705: "Tis true, and, till then, misfortunes are a mirror for our blessings."

hm1c0801: "Hast thought upon who is likely to succeed our master?"
HM3C0802: "Surely not for many years!"
hm1c0803: "Art thou blind? He is old. And the master forgers do jostle each other for precedence."
HM3C0804: "I spy not on my betters. Tis in the Builder's hands."
hm1c0805: "Tis true, tis true."

hm2c0901: "Even the Baron doth finally act against evil. When prodded with enough vigor."
Hm1c0902: "Meanest thou the action on DeWall's thugs?"
hm2c0903: "Verily. Some have told me it was his own brethren, who in sin didst turn him in."
Hm1c0904: "Thieves betray their own, now as always."

HM3C1001: "Some do say the Baron means to raise the tariffs again, even on greens and meat."
hm1c1002: "The wretched man serves only the merchants and his own greed."
HM3C1003: "His grandfather cared less for his pocketed gold and more for his soul's health. But no longer."
hm1c1004: "The builder's truth it is, that men without belief do soften and fail, as rotten wood."

hm2c1101: "Yet another sewer overflowed, I heard yesterday."
HM3C1102: "The peasants who run the pumps have not the learning to understand them."
hm2c1103: "Thinkst thou that we should take their burden? There is naught strange in a pump or gear to us."
HM3C1104: "And toil in the slime? Thou carest little about thy brothers."

HM3C1201: "Time was, the sinners we take wouldst have no 'second chances'. They were dispatched forthwith to explain their misdeeds to their Builder."
hm2c1202: "Our strength and resolve. Tis not what it once was."
HM3C1203: "And see what our weakness hath gained us. Crime and sin reach to the very heights of the city."

hm1c1301: "Heard thou? Terrius, seeking to save his purse, didst buy his new knife from the Shemenovs, not our smiths."
hm2c1302: "How durst he! Hath he no shame?"
hm1c1303: "He certainly hadst fill of shame, when his blade did snap at supper!"
hm2c1304: "Ha! The Shemenovs are shoddy craftsmen, and Terrius is well learnt of it."

hm1c1401: "Time was, all these halls would be close packed with novices, striving to learn our teachings."
HM3C1402: "There are novices still."
hm1c1403: "But fewer brother, fewer. Youths in this time seek to learn about gold and politics, not honest craft."
HM3C1404: "Twill be their loss when they come of age and know not how to accomplish aught of consequence."

hm2c1501: "Dolan hath told me that his new apprentice had released the tap upon the steam dryer, and scalded himself."
HM3C1502: "Foolishness proves its own punishment. But steam burns are a harsh punishment indeed."
hm2c1503: "Dolan sayeth the boy shall live, but may leaveth the order."
HM3C1504: "Even more foolishness! Fear never shows the true path, only the downslope to corruption."

hm1c1601: "Master forget Dovetail hath finished his work on the spiral gear!"
HM3C1602: "Truly that is news! The constant-width teeth, they mesh properly?"
hm1c1603: "As planned! This shall bring a new standard to the winding machines."

Hm1c1701: "Builder walk with thee."
hm2c1702: "And thee."

Hm1c1801: "Good even."
hm2c1802: "Good even."

hm2c1901: "Praise the Builder."
Hm1c1902: "Aye, praise the Builder."

hm2c2001: "May thy hammer swing true."
HM3C2002: "And thy hand be steady."

hm2c2101: "Hail, brother."
HM3C2102: "Hail and bless his works."

HM3C2201: "Builder's grace to thee."
hm2c2202: "My thanks, brother."

HM3C2301: "Greetings."
Hm1c2302: "Well met!"

HM3C2401: "Builder guide thy hand."
Hm1c2402: "Thine as well!"

Hm1c2501: "Be thy carving ready?"
HM3C2502: "No. Not yet."
