Page_0: "Brothers, Warden Darios hath taken the room neath the bell-tower whilst our guest stayeth. Attend him there with any administrative concerns thou hast.

As per usual, none of the brethren are permitted to interrupt my solitary meditations each eve, except if our guest hath need of me. In such case thou mayest direct him to join me in the gardens.

Priest Frederick"
