Manor:
- Basic lighting
- Basic texturing everywhere
- Roombrushes
    - EAX
- Guards

Manor detailing:
- Detailed, aligned textures
- Ceilings (esp grand chamber, parlor, library, drawing room, bedrooms)
    - first four could have subtle fire/earth/wind/water theming, using lost city
        trim textures and opera wallpapers :)
        grand chamber: fire (fireplace)
        parlor: wind (breeze)
        library: earth (pot plant?)
        drawing room: water (?)
- Make his secret stairs go to an underground pagan shrine
- Remove weird trim on entrance hall stairs, I don't like it
- Windows
- Buttresses on tower
