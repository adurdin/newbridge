Bugs:

- in Mausoleum, the sound extinguishing the torch isn't very audible from the floor below.
- in Mausoleum, closing the sarcophagus doesn't block sound from the catacombs (esp. the haunt)
- Not entirely happy that you could accidentally drop the prophet's hand in the catacombs and then be unable to get it back because of the prophet getting in your face


Manor:
- Basic lighting
- Basic texturing everywhere
- Roombrushes
    - EAX
- Guards

Manor detailing:
- Detailed, aligned textures
- Ceilings (esp grand chamber, parlor, library, drawing room, bedrooms)
    - first four could have subtle fire/earth/wind/water theming, using lost city
        trim textures and opera wallpapers :)
        grand chamber: fire (fireplace)
        parlor: wind (breeze)
        library: earth (pot plant?)
        drawing room: water (?)
- Make his secret stairs go to an underground pagan shrine
- Remove weird trim on entrance hall stairs, I don't like it
- Windows
- Buttresses on tower
