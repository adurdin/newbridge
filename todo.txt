BETA 1 (September)

BETA 2 (October)
================


RELEASE (November)
==================

- Put a short delay before the "Hand carries water..." echoes through the caves.

- Kill the "Uh oh!" line.

- Kill the "scoffs" line from the Keeper conv, unless I've got one?

- Reduce frob distance/priority on tower trapdoor so you don't grab it instead of the crates so easily.

- Think about getting malasdair to record the "What have we here?" and "It's a long way down" lines. And a variant on the "better be quick" that sounds less urgent?

- Can the lights go out just before the ritual pause? Then it should be visible that they're not permanently on.

- Think about scripting the "One down..." and "Now to deliver..." lines, since I have audio for them. And the scripting should be easy now that the two item objectives don't cancel. Either line would fire off when you enter Hammer Square or the Mausoleum, and:
    - the first line plays if only one of the two item objectives is done, or
    - the second line plays if both item objectives are done.

- Can I make the markers give 30 seconds of darkness on Normal, and 20 on Hard, or something like that? 15 is only just enough. 

- change texture on walls (and floor?) of catacomb entrance so it's more visible, and move bone pile to just the other side of trap floor.

- Thief scroll blood decal & text needs tweaking so there's only 50% guesswork (East should be unambiguous, guess is between south and west).
    - see what it looks like if the blood decals vanish one at a time.

- R Soul also reporting crypt doors disappearing (sigh, stupid Thief)

- Mausoleum secret door can frob item through it.

- Block pathfinding on manor kitchen table.

- Everybody's rushing the ritual! Nobody seems to even be attempting to do it stealthily. That's okay, I can ship it this way, but it's definitely not ideal. Maybe I should cut the line to just "Damn, they've already started the ritual!"??

- Entrance to Argaux's secret room should be just a touch bigger, so crouch-walking through it is okay. 4.5 or something.

- Tweak the bedroom lever a little more -- three people now have missed it! Cut the whole tile out from the bath.

- Adjust loot goals down a little.
    - Check people's reports for final loot totals (I should've asked them to post their stats too!)

- Should there be some kind of hint about the sharp-eyed archer?

- Bonus objective for getting the prisoner safely to his hut?

- Bonus objective for stealing the diner's loot without frightening him?

- Bonus objective for stealing the sleeping guard's coins without waking him?

- Bonus objective for stealing the sleeping sitting down guy's loot without waking him?

- Get preferred crediting names from everyone I haven't yet.
    - partly done

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
        - Try Shadow Creepr's new vocals
        - Treat Garrett's lines as three types: inner monologue, briefing, and conversation. Inner monologue should sound more in his head. Briefing should feel a little more directed at player, and conversation a little more directed outwards. If that makes sense.
        - See what cleaning can be done to masterthief3's lines. If not suitable, try to get Yandros's lines to have similar reverb.
        - Make sure everything is in mono! See if energy levels can't be normalised across all conversations.
        - Check a bunch of original voice lines (both Garrett and others) to see what their environment feels like, and aim to match it.
    - Figure out what to do about the Prophet's voice! (maybe just cut?)
        - Just cut
    - Make sure no placeholder lines are left.

- NPC Names!
    - All the ones with "Name_Quintus" right now need new names! :)

- Test mission scripting permutations without hacks
    - On all difficulties! :-/

- Survey all doors for:
    - if they can vanish
    - if they separate rooms properly
    - (for gates) if they correctly don't block sound & vision

- Script & apply room EAXes

- Translations & subtitles
    - French?
    - Russian?

- Briefing video

- Credits video
    - Finalise credits.
    - Revise effects. Consider backgrounds?
    - Take audio into Audacity, get exact beat timings, tweak beatmatching
    - McTaffer's "filth.wav" as a stinger?

- FM packaging
    - Test with fresh GOG, Steam releases
    - Test with NewDarkloader?
