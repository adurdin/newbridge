RELEASE (November)
==================

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
    - Figure out what to do about the Prophet's voice! (maybe just cut?)
    - Make sure no placeholder lines are left.

- NPC Names!
    - All the ones with "Name_Quintus" right now need new names! :)

- Map
    - City map (draw and scan)
    - Hammerite map (draw and scan)
        - sketched Hammerite map is wrong: door for library should be on the North, and the armoury on the South.
        - Sanctuary map doesn't show upper walkways, and it should - they'd be visible
        - Sanctuary map doesn't show bell tower
    - Text (draw and scan separately)
    - Don't forget localised versions! I'll have to add the "- Argaux" to them myself.
    - revise automap properties if the location assignment turns out differently (as it very well might!)
    - German captions: "Anwesen von Lady di Rupo" (Manor of Lady di Rupo)
    - German captions: "Korridor" (for hall in Sanctuary)
    - German captions: "Vorraum" (for Vestibule)
    - For the italian map please replace "Sala"(Hall) with "Corridoio".

- Test mission scripting permutations without hacks
    - On all difficulties! :-/

- Survey all doors for:
    - if they can vanish
    - if they separate rooms properly
    - (for gates) if they correctly don't block sound & vision

- Script & apply room EAXes

- Translations & subtitles

- Briefing video

- Credits video
    - McTaffer's "filth.wav" as a stinger?
