BETA 1 (September)
==================


BETA 2 (October)
================

- Review tulz totals and distribution

- Rich Street Guards?
    -  There's no hiding places at the moment, so currently minimal.
       I kind of like the variation. Get a breather on the way to di Rupo's.
       - The new guard is kinda at the NE gate hard to hide from though :(

- Something in the middle/west of market square to add shadow to allow another path across?

- Add a few more G-man like Keeper sightings:
    - Industrial area
    - Argaux's rooftop, watching the fountain
    - Watching the cemetery
    - Watching Lady di Rupo's

- Rooms:
    - change room archetype for outside gates, so Anax can't be dropped _right_ there.
    - new room archetype for works stations for the same reason
        - anywhere else?
    - new room type + automap location for hammerite upper walkways

- Mountain visibility?

- Sounds
    - Incidental sounds (machinery, water, etc)

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
    - Remove unused placeholder lines (mostly nb1xx)

- NPC Names!
    - And make sure they all have the script that BrotherLionel does that appends status

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.
    - include shadow and shalebridge in thanks

RELEASE (November)
==================

- Map
    - City map (draw and scan)
    - Hammerite map (draw and scan)
        - sketched Hammerite map is wrong: door for library should be on the North, and the armoury on the South.
        - Sanctuary map doesn't show upper walkways, and it should - they'd be visible
        - Sanctuary map doesn't show bell tower
    - Text (draw and scan separately)
    - Don't forget localised versions! I'll have to add the "- Argaux" to them myself.
    - revise automap properties if the location assignment turns out differently (as it very well might!)
    - German captions: "Anwesen von Lady di Rupo" (Manor of Lady di Rupo)
    - German captions: "Korridor" (for hall in Sanctuary)
    - For the italian map please replace "Sala"(Hall) with "Corridoio".

- Unload unused textures, if I _really_ care:
    "Texture RAM in use in WR ~2593Kb, ~3237Kb loaded but not in world"

- Test mission scripting permutations without hacks
    - On all difficulties! :-/

- Survey all doors for:
    - if they can vanish
    - if they separate rooms properly
    - (for gates) if they correctly don't block sound & vision

- Script & apply room EAXes

- Translations & subtitles

- Briefing video

- Credits video
    - McTaffer's "filth.wav" as a stinger?

- FM packaging
    - Test with fresh GOG, Steam releases
    - Test with Darkloader?
