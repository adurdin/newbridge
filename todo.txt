BETA 1 (September)
==================


BETA 2 (October)
================


Beta 3 (November)
==================

- Disappearing terrain:
    - Between the fountain and the hangman's noose on the map there is a drunk archer in a tower. If you face NW, you can sometimes see a bit of terrain disappear.
    - Standing on the east side of market square and heading west, can sometimes see the Sanctuary roof appear and disappear.

- Cut the bit about the finder's fee from the briefing VO
    - don't forget subtitles in all three languages!
    - don't forget the book either!

- Put a short delay before the "Hand carries water..." echoes through the caves.

- Process and drop in malasdair's re-recoding of "Uh oh", "What have we here? (This looks valuable)" and "It's a long way down" lines. Make sure "What have we here" doesn't clash with the "found secret" sound.
    - do these need translations/subtitles?

- Everybody's rushing the ritual! Nobody seems to even be attempting to do it stealthily. That's okay, I can ship it this way, but it's definitely not ideal. Maybe I should cut the line to just "Damn, they've already started the ritual!"??
    - don't forget subtitles in all three languages!

- Maybe just make all convos remove their ~ControlDevice links at start, for stupid safeguard.

- Should there be some kind of hint about the sharp-eyed archer?

- Get preferred crediting names from everyone I haven't yet.
    - partly done

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
        - Try Shadow Creepr's new vocals
        - Treat Garrett's lines as three types: inner monologue, briefing, and conversation. Inner monologue should sound more in his head. Briefing should feel a little more directed at player, and conversation a little more directed outwards. If that makes sense.
        - See what cleaning can be done to masterthief3's lines. If not suitable, try to get Yandros's lines to have similar reverb.
        - Make sure everything is in mono! See if energy levels can't be normalised across all conversations.
        - Check a bunch of original voice lines (both Garrett and others) to see what their environment feels like, and aim to match it.
    - Figure out what to do about the Prophet's voice! (maybe just cut?)
        - Just cut
    - Make sure no placeholder lines are left.

- NPC Names!
    - All the ones with "Name_Quintus" right now need new names! :)
    - Don't forget Morten!

- Test mission scripting permutations without hacks
    - On all difficulties! :-/

- Script & apply room EAXes
