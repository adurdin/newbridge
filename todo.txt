BETA 1 (September)
==================


BETA 2 (October)
================

- Review loot totals and distribution
- Review tulz totals and distribution

- Detail
    - Windows on buildings around the cemetery?
        - I like that it's dark! So maybe just textured windows and no lights?

- Rich Street Guards?
    -  There's no hiding places at the moment, so currently minimal.
       I kind of like the variation. Get a breather on the way to di Rupo's.
       - The new guard is kinda at the NE gate hard to hide from though :(

- Something in the middle/west of market square to add shadow to allow another path across?

- Add a few more G-man like Keeper sightings:
    - Industrial area
    - Argaux's rooftop, watching the fountain
    - Watching the cemetery
    - Watching Lady di Rupo's

- Rich street: scatter loot And tulz!

- Ritual
    - (Double-check proper triggering of rescued Anax goal after room archetypes)
    - Sounds! Have a sound effect when lights change, for feedback. Maybe even have the
      ambience intensify during the ritual?
    - Add one or two excursions on the west / north sides that allow the player to get up and a little further back (with some more cover). Just for variation really.
    - See if there's any vegetation or similar models that can be draped over the stalagmites and stalactites.

- Mountain visibility?

- Sounds
    - Incidental sounds (machinery, water, etc)

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
    - Remove unused placeholder lines (mostly nb1xx)

DONE. - Review which new strings need translating
    - city_argauxleverair
    - city_argauxleverfire
    - city_argauxleverearth
    - city_argauxleverwater
    - city_cemelements
    - maus_plaque
    - Name_Board
    - Name_Payment
    - Name_Powderkeg
    FREEZE! I've sent these to the translators, so change nothing more now unless it's critical.

- NPC Names!
    - And make sure they all have the script that BrotherLionel does that appends status

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.

RELEASE (November)
==================

- Map
    - City map (draw and scan)
    - Hammerite map (draw and scan)
        - sketched Hammerite map is wrong: door for library should be on the North, and the armoury on the South.
    - Text (draw and scan separately)
    - Don't forget localised versions! I'll have to add the "- Argaux" to them myself.
    - revise automap properties if the location assignment turns out differently (as it very well might!)

- Test mission scripting permutations without hacks
    - On all difficulties! :-/

- Survey all doors for:
    - if they can vanish
    - if they separate rooms properly
    - (for gates) if they correctly don't block sound & vision

- Script & apply room EAXes

- Translations & subtitles

- Briefing video

- Credits video
    - McTaffer's "filth.wav" as a stinger?
