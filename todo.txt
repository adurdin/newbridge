    - Unused20 (SV1/SV2: "There was this big mob of Hammers, circled round some guy like wolves.")
    - Unused2 (GUARD1/GUARD2: "Nothing ever happens ... just patrol around in circles.")
        - YES! Make a guard that just patrols in circles around the front yard, and trigger this
            convo when the player is nearby and another guard passes near. Absolutely worth it!
                - NO. Do that for two of the guards in the market square. I've got the tower convo and
                    the "market this morning" servant convo for the manor.
