BETA 1 (September)
==================


BETA 2 (October)
================

- Hammerite map is wrong: door for library should be on the North, and the armoury on the South.

- Integrate Italian translation into beta 2.

- Change German title to "Ein netter Profit" (short, "Netter Profit")

- Update maus_thiefscroll for translations! Ensure the decal is appropriately placed, and there's no more hints than necessary.

- Review loot totals and distribution
- Review tulz totals and distribution

- Change wood texture on building with rooftop access to Argaux's - it's not clear I think.

- Detail
    - Caves and ritual chamber?
        - So far _nobody_ has noticed the alternative entrance.
            - that's okay, but maybe make it available on all difficulties?

- Rich Street Guards?
    -  There's no hiding places at the moment, so currently minimal.
       I kind of like the variation. Get a breather on the way to di Rupo's.

- Something in the middle/west of market square to add shadow to allow another path across?

- Add a few more G-man like Keeper sightings:
    - Industrial area
    - Argaux's rooftop, watching the fountain
    - Watching the cemetery
    - Watching Lady di Rupo's

- Rich street: scatter loot And tulz!

- Ritual
    - (Double-check proper triggering of rescued Anax goal after room archetypes)
    - Hmm.... maybe have the crystals affect the lights??? So you can frob or smash a crystal to disable it, to disable its lights, maybe temporarily? Hmm... Might add the ingredient I was missing. And then the one in the manor becomes a training one that shows you it can be frobbed and it goes quiet+dark temporarily.
    - Sounds!

- Really need a bell pull in di Rupo's room that triggers the butler's bell.

- Review how well Keeper intervention worked for people.
    - Seems okay so far

- Assign better room archetypes, taking into consideration:
    - Triggers
    - Automap
    - EAX

- Mountain visibility?

- Sounds
    - Incidental sounds (machinery, water, etc)

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
    - Remove unused placeholder lines (mostly nb1xx)

DONE. - Review which new strings need translating
    - city_argauxleverair
    - city_argauxleverfire
    - city_argauxleverearth
    - city_argauxleverwater
    - city_cemelements
    - maus_plaque
    - Name_Board
    - Name_Payment
    - Name_Powderkeg
    FREEZE! I've sent these to the translators, so change nothing more now unless it's critical.

- NPC Names!
    - And make sure they all have the script that BrotherLionel does that appends status

- Test all books in German. Test the "if you play on Expert, you successfully stop the ritual, you find the bonus relic, and you attack the keeper by the canal at the end" scenario that objectives fit."

- Test all books in Italian. Test the "if you play on Expert, you successfully stop the ritual, you find the bonus relic, and you attack the keeper by the canal at the end" scenario that objectives fit."

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.
