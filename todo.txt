BETA 1 (September)
==================


BETA 2 (October)
================

- Update maus_thiefscroll for translations! Ensure the decal is appropriately placed, and there's no more hints than necessary.

- Review loot totals and distribution
- Review tulz totals and distribution

- Detail
    - Caves and ritual chamber?
        - So far _nobody_ has noticed the alternative entrance.

- Rich Street Guards?
    -  There's no hiding places at the moment, so currently minimal.
       I kind of like the variation. Get a breather on the way to di Rupo's.

- Something in the middle/west of market square to add shadow to allow another path across?

- Add a few more G-man like Keeper sightings:
    - Industrial area
    - Argaux's rooftop, watching the fountain
    - Watching the cemetery
    - Watching Lady di Rupo's

- Rich street: scatter loot And tulz!

- Ritual
    - (Double-check proper triggering of rescued Anax goal after room archetypes)
    - Hmm.... maybe have the crystals affect the lights??? So you can frob or smash a crystal to disable it, to disable its lights, maybe temporarily? Hmm... Might add the ingredient I was missing. And then the one in the manor becomes a training one that shows you it can be frobbed and it goes quiet+dark temporarily.

- Really need a bell pull in di Rupo's room that triggers the butler's bell.

- Review how well Keeper intervention worked for people.
    - Seems okay so far

- Assign better room archetypes, taking into consideration:
    - Triggers
    - Automap
    - EAX

- Mountain visibility?

- Sounds
    - Incidental sounds (machinery, water, etc)
    - Ambience plan
    - Ambience schemas (test them with a tool? or just a new test map and reload_schemas?)
    - Add Environmental AmbientHacked entities for ambiences

- City loot
    - Build new interiors (full detail + room brush) as desired  }- (maybe post-beta)
    - Randomised loot / difficulty variations?                   }

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
    - Remove unused placeholder lines (mostly nb1xx)

- Review which new strings need translating
    - city_argauxleverair
    - city_argauxleverfire
    - city_argauxleverearth
    - city_argauxleverwater
    - city_cemelements
    - maus_plaque
    - Name_Board
    - Name_Payment
    - Name_Powderkeg
    FREEZE! I've sent these to the translators, so change nothing more now unless it's critical.

- NPC Names!
    - And make sure they all have the script that BrotherLionel does that appends status
