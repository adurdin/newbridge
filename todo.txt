BETA 1 (September)
==================


BETA 2 (October)
================


Beta 3 (November)
==================

- Cut the bit about the finder's fee from the briefing VO
    - don't forget subtitles in all three languages!
    - don't forget the book either!

- Put a short delay before the "Hand carries water..." echoes through the caves.

- Process and drop in malasdair's re-recoding of "Uh oh", "What have we here? (This looks valuable)" and "It's a long way down" lines. Make sure "What have we here" doesn't clash with the "found secret" sound.
    - do these need translations/subtitles?

- Everybody's rushing the ritual! Nobody seems to even be attempting to do it stealthily. That's okay, I can ship it this way, but it's definitely not ideal. Maybe I should cut the line to just "Damn, they've already started the ritual!"??
    - don't forget subtitles in all three languages!

- Does maus puzzle fail on load? Lemcovich said he'd quicksaved after the first four, then all the other combinations failed.

- Think about scripting the "One down..." and "Now to deliver..." lines, since I have audio for them. And the scripting should be easy now that the two item objectives don't cancel. Either line would fire off when you enter Hammer Square or the Mausoleum, and:
    - the first line plays if only one of the two item objectives is done, or
    - the second line plays if both item objectives are done.
    - do these need translations/subtitles?

- nightshifter encountered a Hammerite guard outside the sanctuary who was stopped dead, not moving and not apparently reacting to anything (is this the cowardly one - yes it is? is this their aiwatch pseudoscript fucking up? or an absolute-priority response, or what?)
    - was using TFix 1.26?
    - He's stuck in: [AI(870) Watch: Flow] changed goal to "'Custom Goal' at priority 'Absolute'", ability "Converse"
        - Review all Absolute priority pseudoscripts he's got (convo cancel?)

- nightshifter reporting handoff conversation starting twice, or starting while Anax not properly dropped? (something about pressing "use item" multiple times?)
    - was using TFix 1.26? bug no longer happens with TFix 1.26a?
    - how did they get the convo to trigger without dropping the Anax??!?
        - Eh. Maybe just make all convos remove their ~ControlDevice links at start, for stupid safeguard.

- Adjust loot goals down a little, maybe -300.
    - Check people's reports for final loot totals (I should've asked them to post their stats too!)

- Should there be some kind of hint about the sharp-eyed archer?

- Get preferred crediting names from everyone I haven't yet.
    - partly done

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
        - Try Shadow Creepr's new vocals
        - Treat Garrett's lines as three types: inner monologue, briefing, and conversation. Inner monologue should sound more in his head. Briefing should feel a little more directed at player, and conversation a little more directed outwards. If that makes sense.
        - See what cleaning can be done to masterthief3's lines. If not suitable, try to get Yandros's lines to have similar reverb.
        - Make sure everything is in mono! See if energy levels can't be normalised across all conversations.
        - Check a bunch of original voice lines (both Garrett and others) to see what their environment feels like, and aim to match it.
    - Figure out what to do about the Prophet's voice! (maybe just cut?)
        - Just cut
    - Make sure no placeholder lines are left.

- NPC Names!
    - All the ones with "Name_Quintus" right now need new names! :)

- Test mission scripting permutations without hacks
    - On all difficulties! :-/

- Script & apply room EAXes
