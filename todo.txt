BETA 1 (September)
==================


BETA 2 (October)
================


Beta 3 (November)
==================

- So, what happens if you take the Anax and/or the Hand before getting the objective... does the corresponding "one down" / "now to deliver" line get cancelled?

- Canal keeper needs to be a little more visible -- either a few moments longer before disappearing, or visible from the start point.

- Cut the bit about the finder's fee from the briefing VO
    - don't forget subtitles in all three languages!
    - don't forget the book either!

- Process and drop in malasdair's re-recoding of "Uh oh", "What have we here? (This looks valuable)" and "It's a long way down" lines. Make sure "What have we here" doesn't clash with the "found secret" sound.
    - do these need translations/subtitles?

- Everybody's rushing the ritual! Nobody seems to even be attempting to do it stealthily. That's okay, I can ship it this way, but it's definitely not ideal. Maybe I should cut the line to just "Damn, they've already started the ritual!"??
    - don't forget subtitles in all three languages!

- Maybe just make all convos remove their ~ControlDevice links at start, for stupid safeguard.

- Should there be some kind of hint about the sharp-eyed archer?

- Get preferred crediting names from everyone I haven't yet.
    - partly done

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
        - See what cleaning can be done to masterthief3's lines. If not suitable, try to get Yandros's lines to have similar reverb.
    - Cut the Prophet's voice!
    - Make sure no placeholder lines are left.

- NPC Names!
    - All the ones with "Name_Quintus" right now need new names! :)
    - Don't forget Morten!

- Test mission scripting permutations without hacks
    - On all difficulties! :-/

- Script & apply room EAXes
