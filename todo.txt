BETA 1 (September)
==================


BETA 2 (October)
================


RELEASE (November)
==================

- Thief scroll blood decal & text needs tweaking so there's only 50% guesswork (East should be unambiguous, guess is between south and west).
    - see what it looks like if the blood decals vanish one at a time.

- R Soul also reporting crypt doors disappearing (sigh, stupid Thief)

- Mausoleum secret door can frob item through it.

- Block pathfinding on manor kitchen table.

- Everybody's rushing the ritual! Nobody seems to even be attempting to do it stealthily. That's okay, I can ship it this way, but it's definitely not ideal. Maybe I should cut the line to just "Damn, they've already started the ritual!"??

- Entrance to Argaux's secret room should be just a touch bigger, so crouch-walking through it is okay. 4.5 or something.

- Tweak the bedroom lever a little more -- three people now have missed it! Cut the whole tile out from the bath.

- Adjust loot goals down a little.
    - Check people's reports for final loot totals (I should've asked them to post their stats too!)

- Should there be some kind of hint about the sharp-eyed archer?

- Bonus objective for getting the prisoner safely to his hut?

- Bonus objective for stealing the diner's loot without frightening him?

- Bonus objective for stealing the sleeping guard's coins without waking him?

- Bonus objective for stealing the sleeping sitting down guy's loot without waking him?

- Get preferred crediting names from everyone I haven't yet.
    - partly done

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.

- Proper VO
    - Process and normalise
        - Try Shadow Creepr's new vocals
        - Treat Garrett's lines as three types: inner monologue, briefing, and conversation. Inner monologue should sound more in his head. Briefing should feel a little more directed at player, and conversation a little more directed outwards. If that makes sense.
        - See what cleaning can be done to masterthief3's lines. If not suitable, try to get Yandros's lines to have similar reverb.
        - Make sure everything is in mono! See if energy levels can't be normalised across all conversations.
        - Check a bunch of original voice lines (both Garrett and others) to see what their environment feels like, and aim to match it.
    - Figure out what to do about the Prophet's voice! (maybe just cut?)
        - Just cut
    - Make sure no placeholder lines are left.

- NPC Names!
    - All the ones with "Name_Quintus" right now need new names! :)

- Test mission scripting permutations without hacks
    - On all difficulties! :-/

- Survey all doors for:
    - if they can vanish
    - if they separate rooms properly
    - (for gates) if they correctly don't block sound & vision

- Script & apply room EAXes

- Translations & subtitles
    - French?
    - Russian?

- Briefing video

- Credits video
    - Finalise credits.
    - Revise effects. Consider backgrounds?
    - Take audio into Audacity, get exact beat timings, tweak beatmatching
    - McTaffer's "filth.wav" as a stinger?

- FM packaging
    - Test with fresh GOG, Steam releases
    - Test with NewDarkloader?
