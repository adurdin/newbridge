- Canal keeper needs to be a little more visible -- either a few moments longer before disappearing, or visible from the start point.

- Cut the bit about the finder's fee from the briefing VO
    - don't forget subtitles in all three languages!
    - don't forget the book either!

- Everybody's rushing the ritual! Nobody seems to even be attempting to do it stealthily. That's okay, I can ship it this way, but it's definitely not ideal. Maybe I should cut the line to just "Damn, they've already started the ritual!"??
    - don't forget subtitles in all three languages!

- Maybe just make all convos remove their ~ControlDevice links at start, for stupid safeguard.

- Should there be some kind of hint about the sharp-eyed archer?

- Get preferred crediting names from everyone I haven't yet.
    - partly done

- Review and update credits and so on in readme.

- NPC Names!
    - All the ones with "Name_Quintus" right now need new names! :)
