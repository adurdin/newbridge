# Plan for room archetypes and EAX settings:
#
# - One archetype for each type of room, so I can set EAX by archetype
#   instead of tediously room-by-room. (eax_set_archetype <archetype_id>,<room_type>)
#
# - Doorway rooms should have each half matching the larger room on its side.
#
# - Keep all room EAX settings in a script so it can be rerun.
#
# - For final release, customise EAX of some rooms according to their wall/floor/
#   ceiling/furnishings/size, where it seems necessary. Add the change to the script.
#
# - One archetype for each room/group of rooms that needs objectives,
#   scripts and/or links. (marked here with *)
