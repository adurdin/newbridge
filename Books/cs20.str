Page_0: "Thank you for beta testing this mission!

Please hop over to the Shalebridge Cradle forum and share how the mission was: what was good, what was bad, and what was simply broken.

It's not just bugs I'm interested in: I'd like to know what difficulty you chose, the style you played in, where the mission was too easy, where it was too hard; where it felt boring, and where it was fun.
