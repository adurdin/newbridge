[somewhere in the market place...]

The hammers are now charging fifty gold pieces for every cart that passes, and twenty for every man with a burden. Tis extortionate! Whilst others mayhap can have their supplies carried on foot through Biron Lane, there is no chance a sheep carcass--let alone a whole beef--can fit down that narrow alleyway. Last month their tolls consumed so much coin I could just barely pay the Lady's dues. We all know what happened to Harcourt when he missed his dues last month...  With this new rise in tolls, I just don't know how I'm going to manage!
