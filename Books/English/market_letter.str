[somewhere in the market place...]

The hammers are now charging fifty gold pieces for every cart that passes, and twenty for every man with a burden. Tis extortionate! Whilst others mayhap can have their supplies carried on foot through Biron Street, there is no chance a sheep carcass--let alone a whole beef--can fit down that narrow lane. Last month their tolls consumed all the coin I had set aside to pay the Lady's dues. I explained the situation, but was told in no uncertain terms that I had better not miss this month. But with the latest rise in tolls, I don't know what I'm going to do!
