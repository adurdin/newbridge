Page_0: "Warden and dear Brother Darios,

'Tis unfortunate thou findest thy temporary accommodations irksome. Knowest thou well that the Anax of Easthart is an honored guest here, and deserveth the best room that we mayest find. All of us here hath sacrificed to provide for our guest. Thou knowest also how mine lungs suffereth from damp, else I wouldst gladly take thy place neath the tower. But 'tis on us all to bear humbly the burdens the Builder hath assigned. For as the iron that is hammered well softeneth and yieldeth to the will of the forger, so by trial the Builder annealeth us, that we may better serve Him.

Priest Frederick"
